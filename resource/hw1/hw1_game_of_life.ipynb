    "### Conway’s Game of Life\n",
    "Conway’s Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a classic example of a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game is a classic example of how simple rules can give rise to complex behavior. The game is played on an m-by-n board, which we will represent as an m-by-n matrix. The game proceeds in steps. At any given time, each cell of the board (i.e., entry of our matrix), is either alive (which we will represent as a 1) or dead (which we will represent as a 0). At each step, the board evolves according to a few simple rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors becomes a dead cell.   \n",
    "• A live cell with more than three live neighbors becomes a dead cell.   \n",
    "• A live cell with two or three live neighbors remains alive.  \n",
    "• A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.  \n",
    "• All other dead cells remain dead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The neighbors of a cell are the 8 cells adjacent to it, i.e., left, right, above, below, upper- left, lower-left, upper-right and lower-right. We will follow the convention that the board is toroidal, so that using matrix-like notation (i.e., the cell (0,0) is in the upper-left of the board and the first coordinate specifies a row), the upper neighbor of the cell (0,0) is (m − 1,0), the right neighbor of the cell (m − 1,n − 1) is (m − 1,0), etc. That is, the board “wraps around”. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Note: you are not required to use this matrix-like indexing. It’s just what I chose to use to explain the toroidal property."
